            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oure things (good Chriſtian reader) haue cauſed me to be circumſpect in vvriti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g this Book, to vvit, Feare, Care, Neceſſitie, and Affection. Feare afflicted me: Care compelled me: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie bound me: and affection vvounded me. Feare afflicted me becauſe the greef of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into infamie, reproch and troubles, cauſed a great circumſpection in me, to mark diligently vvhat I vvrote, and to put the ſame dovvne in vvriting vvithout any ſpot of hipocriſie and double dealing. Care compelled me to be circumſpect in my doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, leſt that the Papiſts should finde a bone to gnavv there vpon. Neceſſitie vrged me bothe to anſvver to the infamous Libels vvritten againſt me, and to ſatiſfie (if that I might) the honeſt requeſt of certain zelous Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in vvriting the Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvhich vvere doon at Roome. And as neceſſitie cauſed me to purge my ſelf of
<pb facs="tcp:5966:10"/>the falſe reports of lying Papiſts: ſo dooth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie prouoke me to be circumſpect in all my ſayings, affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtirreth me vp to vvrite thoſe things, vvhich are no leſſe true then profitable. But if my vvritings be neuer ſo true, yet notvvithſtanding, ſome or other buſie headed fellovv vvilſpeak againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I haue not their tungs in keeping, let them ſpeake vvhat they liſt, and I shall arme my ſelf vvith pacience. And heerin vvil I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovve the ſteps of Zenocrates, vvho for his pacience vvas much commended: for though he vvere of his Maiſter Plato vniuſtly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of vngratefulnes, yet vvas he nothing mooued there vvith all, and being aſked vvhy he did not anſvver Platoes defaming of hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made this anſvver. That vvhich I do is good and profitable for me. So I ſay, that vvhich I haue vvritten in this Sermon made at Roome, novv I confeſſe to be true, and I hope this confeſſion shalbe good and profitable for my ſoules helth. And as for the vvords of the Papiſts, as they are but vvi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: ſo let them paſſe as vvinde, as they proceed
<pb facs="tcp:5966:10"/>from a malicious hart, ſo I conſter them, and ſo I accept them, not vvith malice but vvith pacience. The pacience of Euſebius teacheth me ſo to doo, for vvhen a vvicked vvoman, infected vvith the hereſies of Arrius, had vvilfully throvvne aſtone at him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith all had vvounded him to death: hee vvas ſo far from taking reuenge, that he ſvvare his freends vpon his death bed, not to punish her therfore. O noble minde, O ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous act vvorthy of eternall memorie, he forgaue her that vvas his enemie and did him great iniurie. The like pacience GOD graunt vnto me, that vvhatſoeuer the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay or doo againſt me: I be not angrye therfore, but take all things in good parte, and pray for them, that they may haue a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hart, to be ſory for their dooings and ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings, againſt them vvhich vvish them no othervviſe, then to them ſelues: one faith in Ieſu Chriſte, &amp; brotherly looue one tovvard an other.

Duety bindeth me to ſende vnto you this Oration and Sermon, made at <hi>Roome,</hi> written then in Latin, but nowe in Engliſhe, for the profite and commoditie of the ruder ſort (who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the Latin tongue) which Oration and Sermon, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I purpoſe God willing, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of my Superiours, as it was once written and regiſtred at <hi>Roome</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5966:12"/>in the Latin tongue, ſo to write it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and bring it to light. My intent and purpoſe is not, in writing this booke, to gape for popular applauſe, and to hunt after prayſe: but to ſignifie to the world what I haue bene, and what I haue doone. I haue been a member of the Romiſhe Church, as it is well knowne to many, who bothe knewe me, and were conuerſant with me at <hi>Roome.</hi> And at my firſt comming to that <hi>Babilonicall Cittie,</hi> I was ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue bene an Hereticke (for ſo tearme they Chriſtian Catholiques) wherefore by the meanes of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man, named <hi>Salomon Aldred,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a dweller in Birchen lane in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who was maried, and had bene in my company in <hi>France,</hi> I was brought by Doctor <hi>Morice,</hi> prouider of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Hoſpitall at <hi>Roome</hi> (for his owne diſcharge) to the houſe of the <hi>Romiſhe Inquiſition.</hi> Where béeing examined in matters touching Religion, I confeſſed what I had bene in tyme paſt, an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to theyr Religion. When as by the proceſſe of my wordes, the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican Inquiſitour</hi> had intelligence of
<pb facs="tcp:5966:12"/>my former ſtate. He commaunded Doctor <hi>Morice</hi> to bring me before him the day following, which was the .xxvi. day of Aprill, in the yeere of our Lord. <hi>1578.</hi> So the morning after I came vnto him, with Doctor <hi>Morice:</hi> then the ſentence of the fowre <hi>Cardinalles,</hi> which are appertayning to that office, was this, that I ſhould write what I could (with frée lybertie of ſpéeche and pardon graunted) againſt the Pope, and againſt his Religion. Béeing thus commaunded, as I would auoide the Popes indignation and diſpleaſure, to write what I could againſt his ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tytle and preſumptuous name of ſupremacie: I ſpared neyther him, neyther yet, his vnſtable Religion, as héerafter in the Sermon made at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:5966:13"/>forgetting to giue me thankes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing fréendſhip, he willed a Letter to be written to the Rector of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Seminarie, that he ſhould aſcribe me to the number of the reſt. And the Letters béeing deliuered and read, both of him and Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Engliſh houſe: I was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the .xxviii. day of May, to the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Engliſh Students. For ſo much as the Religion of the Papiſts is grounded vpon lyes, ſo can they doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but lie, and report vntruelie. Wheras a Maſſe-monger, who writeth that he did not only knowe me, but alſo lyued with me, falſely reporteth in his Lybell ſet out againſt me, <hi>That I was recommended from Cardinall <hi>Paleote</hi> of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to Doctor <hi>Lewes,</hi> that by his meanes I might finde ſome releefe at the Popes handes:</hi> this reporte is as true, as nowe I am in Wales.</p>
            <p>As touching Doctor <hi>Lewes,</hi> there was not ſo much as one word ſpoken, much leſſe a Letter written vnto him: But this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely fruite of theyr Religion, to ſpeake more then trueth is, to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him wrongfully, that dooth degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

And for the breach of the fowrth decrée of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> which was no crime in déede, for that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée is vnlawfull. Should I excuſe the murther by this Pope committed, as the murthers of <hi>Sampſon?</hi> Should I commend the deuilliſhe practiſes, and cruell attempts of this Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to haue the lyues of the true Chriſtians in the lowe Countries abreuiated, theyr countrie ſpoyled, theyr houſes burnt, theyr Cattell ſlaine, theyr Daughters rauiſhed, theyr Sonnes murthred, euen
<pb facs="tcp:5966:14"/>in the ſight of theyr Fathers, and the Parentes eyther made ſlaues, or elſe conſtrayned before the due courſe of nature, to yéelde vp the ghoſt? Of all this calamitie, iniurie, and murther, the Pope is the onely cauſe and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. This I knowe to be true, this I am able to auouch, this I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide to write. Should I prayſe your Pope béeing an adulterer? or ſhould I cloake his faulte, as the adulterie of <hi>Iacob?</hi> Should I thinke your Pope to be a holie Virgin, hauing two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardes, the one made a Cardinall, the other a Marqueſſe? the one a ruler of his Caſtle, <hi>Santo Angelo,</hi> the other <hi>Grand mon Signior</hi> of his abyding Pallace. Should I coullour his robberies, as the robbing of the <hi>Egiptians?</hi> what rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries hath he done in the Churches of <hi>Italie,</hi> to mayntaine the Engliſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, bothe at <hi>Roome</hi> and at <hi>Rheimes</hi> in <hi>Fraunce?</hi> he hath compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the moſt part of all Abbottes, and Priours, and other Eccleſiaſticall men, to diſburſe him about a twelue month paſt, a ſumme of money.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I haue ſpoken truely, bothe

            <pb facs="tcp:5966:15"/>
            <p>I wyll haue an eſpeciall care to the wordes which I ſhall write, leaſt that in miſreporting ought of you raſhly, I incurre deſeruedly, the diſpleaſure of almighty God, and may not be frée of infamy, and the hatred of ſuch as haue been trauellers, who knew them ſelues many things to be true, which I intend to bring to light, iuſtly I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. I would thou Papiſt hadſt the ſame minde, not to haue excéeded the bondes and lymittes of trueth, becauſe they thought to bring my name to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit by theyr vntrueths, they thought it good to ſcatter abroade theyr lying Lybels, to the ende that ſome, who are weake of beléefe, and others which are inclyning to Papiſtrie, might reiect my writing, and make no accoumpt of my ſayinges: howe falſe theyr Lybel was, you may reade as followeth.</p>
            <p>The firſt vntrueth is this, that where as be vntruely reporteth: <hi>That I was brought vp in Poperie, and therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewed, vntyll for pouertie, paſsing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the water into the Weſte partes of Englande, I became a Miniſter:</hi> Which is as true, as thou art a true ſubiect to
<pb facs="tcp:5966:15"/>the Quéenes Maieſtie, which is nothing ſo, for thou art an enimie to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and to her procéedinges. It is well knowne that none of my fréendes are Papiſtes, or that they ſhould bring me vp in Papiſtrie: It is not doubtfull to a hundred and not ſo fewe, that before I went to the Weſt countries, I ſtudied at <hi>Oxenford,</hi> &amp; remained in <hi>White Hall,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Ieſus Colledge,</hi> one yéere, and from thence I we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to <hi>Brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſe Colledge,</hi> from the which Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I departed, &amp; came to my fréends, and there in myne owne Countrey, I taught a certayne Gentlemans chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the ſpace of one yéere &amp; a halfe, and afterwardes I was made a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſo paſſed ouer the waters, and ſerued a Cure which is named <hi>Withie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe,</hi> vnder one Maiſter <hi>Iones,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Tauntone,</hi> and from that place I went to <hi>Whiteſtauntone,</hi> and there continewed vntyll the tyme I paſſed ouer the Seas. And where as thou writeſt, <hi>That by learning three or foure of Maiſter Northbrookes ſermons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke, I got mee ſome credite for preaching:</hi> With Maiſter <hi>Northbrooke</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5966:16"/>I neuer had conference, neyther recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any Sermon that euer he or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made. Neyther were my wordes ſuch at any time, that the people tooke me for a young <hi>Tobias,</hi> and a ſecond <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi> Neyther ſpake I at any time, that by meanes of ſimmony, I got me two Benefices. Your Religion conſiſteth on lyes, and you followe that Religion whereof the Deuill is Author, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all lyes: You haue Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and you haue the Popes diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to doo with an Hereticke (for this name you attribute to euery Chriſtian) what your lyſt, and what your pleaſure is, to diſcredite him if you may, or to hurt him if it lyeth in your power, or to ſubuert and ouerthrow the trueth of the ſacred Goſpell you wyll not ceaſe. I know what you be, I haue liued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt you, you can not further one good word to him that meaneth vprightly, &amp; ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth truely. Call to remembrance, haue you not vſed the lyke rayling ſpéech, and the lyke ſlaunders againſt a godlie and learned defendour of Chriſt his trueth, <hi>Iohn Iuell</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Saliſbury?</hi> you were not aſhamed (ſo impudent you are) to
<pb facs="tcp:5966:16"/>ſay, that béeing mad, he preached at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisburie,</hi> and was commaunded to come downe from the Pulpit, for that he ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the people. Moreouer, that he wrote againſt his conſcience, and dyed a Papiſt: that his man had told him, that he cited a wrong place of the Doctours: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he lightly ſetting by his words, would néedes cite a thing which was not expreſſed in the Doctours. What they ſpeake of others, with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence I paſſe ouer, and how falſely they accuſe them, all the world may iudge, reade theyr bookes againſt the lyues of faithfull and learned Miniſters of God his holy word. I am not gréeued verie much, for that they haue vniuſtly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of me, I arme my ſelf with patience. I know their canckred ſtomacks is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to doo me what diſpleaſure they may, they are not able to prooue the leaſt iote of theyr Lybell. How can they prooue that I haue had two Wiues? héere be ſome in <hi>London,</hi> and not fewe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that lyued in that Towne where I lyued and was borne: And beſides that, knewe me whereſoeuer I dwelt in England.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:17"/>
            <p>But neyther they nor any other, knew that euer I was maried, if they can prooue that I was maried once, I wyll be theyr bond man as long as I liue. If they can prooue that I had two Wiues, I ſeeke but the extremitie of the lawe, yea, requyre death it ſelfe. I wyll tell them the places where my chéefeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode was in Wales or England. In the common Schooles that were in that Sheere where I was borne, I was brought vp, vntyll I was of the age of ſixtéene yéeres, and at that age I went to <hi>Oxenford,</hi> and from thence I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe againe to my Countrey, and abode at a place called <hi>Dunreuen,</hi> and from thence I went to <hi>Summerſet,</hi> and ſtayed at <hi>Withiecombe,</hi> from the which place I departed and came to <hi>Whitſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> and from thence I departed and came to <hi>London,</hi> tooke ſhipping, and arriued at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> where part of your Company abydeth, I lodged at an Inne not farre from the gate that goeth to <hi>Macklin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In lying, he procéedeth farther: <hi>He ſayth, that I became a Souldiour againſt the King, and vttered to the Prince of
<pb facs="tcp:5966:17"/>Orainge, part what poſsiblie I could deuiſe, or what I heard in England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, and attempted many moſt malicious thinges that waye:</hi> And that I reported not ſo, of my ſelfe mine Hoſteſſe (who is an Engliſhe woman) may remember, that there was a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at her houſe, but not a Souldiour, ſuch a one that gaue her Daughter a thymble in ſiluer, which I found in a Church: there I ſtayde not aboue fiue or ſix dayes, but dyrectly tooke my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Dowaie.</hi> And whereas you ſay, <hi>That I found releefe at Cambraie,</hi> in deed of certayne Flemmiſh Prelates, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſome bountifulneſſe, but of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men found no reléefe, for ſcarſe they were able to reléeue them ſelues, ſo lytle eſtéemed they were of Citizens, who for the greater part were Chriſtians. And for that you falſely ſay, <hi>That I fell into the hands of the Kinges ſide:</hi> That is as true as you ſaye, that you pray for the Quéene of England, where as you pray rather for the Quéene of Scottes, as héereafter it ſhall appeare. And where as you ſaye that I reported at <hi>Rheimes, That I was driuen out of Englande, for
<pb facs="tcp:5966:18"/>my conſcience ſake.</hi> Who would thinke that I reported thus? where as before ſome of the Scholers, I feared not to pronounce our Quéene ſupreame head of England, and béeing examined of what Religion I was, I aunſwered, a Proteſtant, for ſpeaking the which wordes I was baniſhed the Towne. And Doctor <hi>Allen,</hi> with the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie, were commaunded to appéere before the Conſuls, and Captaines of the Towne, and were like to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of the Towne, onely for that they thought that the Engliſh men had ſuccoured me, beeing a Chriſtian. As for reléefe, I found not as much as a farthing, except a dinner amongſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Engliſh Préeſtes, who kept ſuch a rayling againſt my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> who is dead, and whome they ſayd ſhould frit in hell: and againſt Sir <hi>Frauncis Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham,</hi> and againſt my Lord <hi>Burley,</hi> and againſt diuers others, whome they ſayd, God would condempne and iudge to euerlaſting paine. This dinner dyd me but lyttle good, for they were in a pelting chafe againſt the wiſe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beleeuers of Chriſt his Goſpell: they
<pb facs="tcp:5966:18"/>were angrie alſo with me, for that I had ſworne by the Maſſe, and had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a worde or two in defence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>From this Cittie I went to <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi> and there ſtayde with an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop thrée monthes, and from him I trauelled to <hi>Italie,</hi> and dwelt with the Biſhoppe of <hi>Vigeuena,</hi> whoſe name is <hi>Alexander Cazalis,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes <hi>Protono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,</hi> and kept all his Plate in cuſtodie, and who would haue giuen to me a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonſhip if I would haue ſtaid with him during lyfe: which thing to be true, you your ſelues know that were Préeſtes at <hi>Roome,</hi> for thereof the Biſhoppe wrote a Letter, and ſent his man with me to <hi>Millaine</hi> to Doctor <hi>Parkar,</hi> who alſo wrote a Letter to the Scholers of the Engliſh Seminarie. This his looue towardes me, did I not obtaine in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king vntrueth, but for that he had bene a traueller himſelfe to forraine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and had tried aduerſitie him ſelfe, as he fell into the handes of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, vpon which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration he tooke compaſſion on me, béeing a ſtraunger, and in pouertie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:19"/>
            <p>Moreouer, whereas thou writeſt, <hi>That I ſlaundered the lyues of the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Miniſters, and other profeſſours of England.</hi> That is as true as they ſaye, that it is lawfull to rebell againſt our Soueraigne, for I neuer miſrepor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any Biſhoppes Chaplaines: how could I tell how Biſhops &amp; Miniſters lyued? I neuer was conuerſant with them: As for other Miniſters, I muſt néedes confeſſe thus much I ſpake, that in the beginning of this Quéens raigne when Miniſters were ſomewhat ſcant, through occaſion well knowen, then there were certaine honeſt zealous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſupplied the roome for a time, but afterward by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly care of the Biſhops, were otherwiſe prouided for, &amp; learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> placed in their roome, which being ſo néere driuen by caſualty of the time, vpon the great godlineſſe &amp; earneſt zeale of ſuch men, did ſo order it while til they were better prouided for.</p>
            <p>But whereas thou ſaydeſt, <hi>That I of mine owne freewill went to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to obtayne greater credite:</hi> This is as true as thou ſayeſt, <hi>That I preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelfe, and accuſed my ſelfe that I
<pb facs="tcp:5966:19"/>had beene a Papiſt:</hi> Where as it is well knowen, I was taken at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and brought by a Purſuinant to the right honourable Sir <hi>Frauncis Walſingham,</hi> and by his commaundement was ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and from him I was brought by the Purſuinant to the Towre of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, as before I haue deelared, I was brought ſuſpected an Heretick at <hi>Rome</hi> by Doctor <hi>Morice,</hi> to the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> But where as thou ſayeſt, <hi>I neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very ſpytefully, to detract and ſpeak euyll of the Proteſtants:</hi> this is as true as the reſt. But this I confeſſe, that I much diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the liues of ſuch who outwardly bare great ſhow of zealous Proteſtantes, and inwardly were craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diſſembling Papiſts, when they came in companye with any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, then they were as zealous as they themſelues, but when they came in conference with Papiſts: they were as earneſt in conſcience as they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, carrying in one hand both fire and water, to deceiue the ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that did not miſtruſt them, &amp; to ſéede the Diuell with that he would haue, againſt this
<pb facs="tcp:5966:20"/>enormitie I did not a little inueigh, for that I thought it worthy of all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſiou. But as for otherwiſe defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Proteſtants, thy wordes are moſt vntrue, and I neuer opened my mouthe to vſe any ſuch ſpéeches.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, whereas you ſay: <hi>That I delighted in flattery.</hi> This you ſpeake of mallice, and not of trueth, for I ſéeke to flatter none for preferment ſake, as thou ſayſt I doo. Becauſe I ſpeake the trueth by thée, and ſuch as thou art, therefore thou ſayſt I flatter: I gape not for preferment, neyther for any worldly pelfe, I will be contented with Gods prouidence, as he hath or dayned, ſo ſhall it be with me: happe well, or hap ill, the Lords name be prayſed. To flatter any man for exhibition ſake, I intend it not, let them doo as they liſt, and as God ſhall put in their mindes.</p>
            <p>Whether I liue in myſerie, or elſe otherwiſe, Gods wil I am not to reſiſt, but accept all thinges patientlye, and ſpeake well of the name of the Lorde, who ſcourgeth whom he will, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth whom he will.</p>
            <p>And moreouer: <hi>Thou counteſt me
<pb facs="tcp:5966:20"/>no better then halfe a foole, as others maye eaſilie perceaue, if they make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of mee.</hi> Truelie, I confeſſe I had rather be counted a foole, and profeſſe the trueth: then be named a wiſe man, and committe idolatrie. The tyme hath béene, that bothe thou and thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes had good hope of me, that I ſhould be an inſtrument to mayntaine your idolatrous and ſuperſtitious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>And where as thou ſayſt: <hi>That I was vnable to goe foreward in Logicque, or Philoſophie.</hi> This procéeded not of the rudeneſſe of my capacitie: but of the mallice which Father <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> (the Prefect of the Engliſhe Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) bare to the Welſhmen: There were Batchelers of Arte, not permitted to beginne theyr courſe of Logicque or Philoſophie, which is an vſuall thing at <hi>Roome</hi> for Batchelers, yea, &amp; Maiſters of Arte, eyther to be permitted to heare Rhetorique, or to beginne Logicque. And wheras thou writeſt, that I wrote in my booke: <hi>That I preached before the Pope.</hi> I wrote no ſuch things, the booke is extant, who that wyll may reade it.
<pb facs="tcp:5966:21"/>And there he ſhall finde that my wordes are thus in effect: <note place="margin">Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the fault of the Printer, and to diſcharge my ſelfe of the Papiſtes obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in this point: l giue you to vnderſtand, that he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtooke him ſelfe, in prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before the Pope, vvhereas I vvrote it, a Sermon pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted before the Pope. Wherfore I deſire par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his offence, and mine owne negligence, in not vſing more reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in that place.</note>
               <hi>I made an Oration and a Sermon at Roome, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the Pope and all his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalles, with diuers other in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie. And the ſame Oration and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (which was my Recantation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) and for the which the Pope gaue me thankes, &amp; regiſtred it in three great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, in the houſe of Inquiſition.</hi> Theſe wordes I ſpake, and theſe wordes are true: and there is one in <hi>London,</hi> who was at <hi>Roome</hi> then, and knewe of this my dooing, &amp; knew me alſo, who will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame to be true. Thou writeſt moreouer: <hi>That with vaine brags, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the Sermon which I made at Roome in the Engliſh Seminarie, vpon Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day laſt, <hi>Advincula.</hi>
               </hi> Thou art deceyued, I bragge not thereof, I made mention thereof onely for this cauſe, to ſignifie to the Readers, howe within thrée dayes after, I became ſicke, and diſpayred of my ſaluation, for that I miſtruſted many points of that Romiſh Religion, and could not tell whether they were true or falſe. And where thou ſaiſt: <hi>That it was an exerciſe that Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
<pb facs="tcp:5966:21"/>vſe.</hi> I ſtudied poſitiue Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not <hi>Grammar,</hi> nor neuer dyd at <hi>Roome,</hi> and it was an exerciſe which the ſtudentes in Diuinitie vſed. And where as thou ſayſt: <hi>Thou knoweſt who was at it, and laughed to heare ſuch ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ſtuffe as that was.</hi> To ſpeake a worde or two to make laughter: it is the part of an Oratour, and it is the part of a Preacher.</p>
            <p>But the ſame Latin Sermon dyd ſo content them at that preſent tyme, that they doubted not to ſaye, but that I ſhould peruert many in England, and ſhould become a profitable ſeruant to the Pope, and his Romiſh Sinagogue. How father <hi>Miniſter,</hi> a graue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> commended my dooings, and ſayd I was one of the beſt Oratours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the whole rowt of Students: And as for to ſpeake Latin, I taught y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt part of them all to ſpeake true La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, although they were farre from any <hi>Ciceronian</hi> phraſe. They haue ſuch blockheads that ſtudie Philoſophie, that in talke they vſe an Accuſatiue caſe, in ſtéede of a Nominatiue, and the Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, in ſtéede of a Feminine gender,
<pb facs="tcp:5966:22"/>and I wyll name them for your ſakes, Maſter <hi>Dodipol Oliuerius,</hi> Maſter Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Doctor (I would ſay) <hi>Muſhe,</hi> with twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie more: they are not able to make a true conſtruction, betwixt the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue caſe, and the Verbe, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiue and the Adiectiue, the Relatiue and his Antecedent. Yet for all that, by meanes of theyr déepe Philoſophie, they thinke to ouer-crowe our Studentes, héere in England. They that ſtudie Diuinitie (when they are commaunded to make ſuch an Exhortation as I haue done often, in your Seminarie of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chéefe, for I can not ſay of learning, or yet of vertue. I would I could,) they aſcend vp to the Pulpit with a brazen face, or a fooles vizarde: but they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende with ſhame, and with diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, ſome haue I ſéene of your company iollie Champions, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to preach, but were not able to proſecute theyr matter: Wherfore they came downe from the Pulpitte, and left halfe theyr Sermons vnſayde, for that they had forgotten the reſidue of theyr Sermon: eyther for that they quafte too much Wine, or elſe that
<pb facs="tcp:5966:22"/>they had ſupt too much pottage. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two (according to the report of Father <hi>Miniſter</hi>) of whome I ſpake, and who ſoone after Saint <hi>Peter, ad Vincula,</hi> his day dyed: There was not one amongſt thrée ſcore, that coulde preache as well as our common Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Shoomakers in England.</p>
            <p>In déede, they excelled them in one point, for that they obſerued more guyle and deceipt in theyr preaching, to intrap our Engliſhe men in the ſnares of idolatrie: then men of Occupation in perſuading the people to decline from papiſtrie.</p>
            <p>And whereas verie impudentlie thou ſayſt: <hi>I was a common game to the reſt of the Studentes, who made me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to mount on a ſtoole, and to preach to them the Sermons, which I had vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in England.</hi> Thine owne fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, ſuch as are taken, denie the ſame to be true, as they doo the reſt of the chéefeſt pointes of thy infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lybell: he that was my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fellowe, maye reporte this to be a lye, as the reſt of thy Articles.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:23"/>
            <p>If he report truely, this is all, that he or any other is able to auouch: That béeing merelie diſpoſed, I once (but neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes) ſtoode vpon a ſtoole, (as the Ieſuits doo when they preach, ſtanding vpon bulks, or elſe vpon ſtooles) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of him, who is nowe priſoner in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towze, to giue me what Theame he would, and ſo be dyd, and therevpon made a diſcourſe <hi>Extempore.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vntruth, to report that I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a Sermon, vttered once before in England, and to ſay that I dyd it oftner then once. The lyke thing many of you haue done, whoſe names I could recite: but becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter is of no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I wyll not name them at all. Good man lyer, (I knowe not thy name, for that thou haſt not written it, belike thou wert aſhamed to name thy ſelfe, leaſt thou mighteſt be taken, and thy treacheries eſpied.)</p>
            <p>Wheras thou ſayſt, <hi>That I lingred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde my fellowes, at a Towne in <hi>Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi> called <hi>Fuligne.</hi>
               </hi> That is as true as the Pope hath made thee a Cardinal, for I left them &amp; their bay Horſe, ouerladen with the Popes bleſſinges: hauing a
<pb facs="tcp:5966:23"/>gréeuous diſeaſe, and not able to goe, in the plaine feeldes I forſooke your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. And if ſo be that this ſickneſſe had not chaunced vnto me: yet had I occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offred me to forſake their company, for they made me pay eleuen <hi>Iulyes</hi> for ſeuen, and cauſed me to pay for their mans charges as well as they. What charity you pelting &amp; wandering Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers haue, I wyll declare.</p>
            <p>There came this laſt Summer, a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Scholer to <hi>Roome,</hi> who could not be admitted to the Colledge, but the Rector taking compaſſion on him, wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fowre Préeſtes (whereof I ſuſpecte thee to be one) who went in my company (for thrée dayes ſpace) to giue this poore Scholer a Crowne a péece, among whome alſo I gaue him a Crowne. But howe vncharitably they vſed him in the iourney for thrée dayes, you may reade as followeth.</p>
            <p>They cauſed him all the way to leade theyr Horſe by the brydle, or to driue him forwardes, yet would they not pay for the mans meate, nor ſuffer him to ryde, béeing verie ſicke, and ſcarſe able to ſtande on his féete, and payde
<pb facs="tcp:5966:24"/>more then a Stranger would haue paid vnto them.</p>
            <p>The thirde day of our iourney, it ſo befell when I departed from them, that this youth was ſo faint, that hée layd himſelfe downe on the ground, in the middle of the feeldes, not able to mooue a foote farther. When they ſawe that he was able to leade theyr Horſe no longer: they forſooke him, not bydding him farewell, neyther giuing him ſo much as the value of one ſmall pennie.</p>
            <p>Behold what charitie Papiſtes haue, behold theyr inhumanitie, to theyr own countrey-man: Héere in England, they ſhewe ſuch counterfeyt holineſſe, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would ſcarſe thinke that they would play the Varlettes, they deceyue the people wounderfullie. But if our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe men had béene ſo much conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant among them as I haue béene, and had tryed theyr manners as I haue done: they would beware howe to giue credite to ſuch hypocriticall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. But if our countrey men, wyll beſtowe the reading of the booke
<pb facs="tcp:5966:24"/>of Pilgrimage, I wyll lyuelie paint foorth the crafte and ſubtiltie of our Engliſhe Studentes beyond the Seas, I will deſcribe the horrible abuſes crept into the Churche of <hi>Roome,</hi> which I haue ſéene with mine eyes, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of many that were credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayſt: <hi>That the firſt Sunday after my comming to the Tower, I refuſed to repayre to the Church.</hi> I graunt it ſo to be. But whereas thou ſayſt: <hi>The ſecond Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, I pronounced this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation of mine, which is nowe in print:</hi> That is as true as a Catte bringeth foorth whelpes, for Maiſter Lieuetenant and my Kéeper, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe, knowe that to be vntrue.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayſt: <hi>That if I ſhall want preferment heere, I wyll goe beyond the Seas againe.</hi> Who wyll beléeue this to be true: where as I haue béene once pardoned already, for that I haue béene of the contrarie Religion, all men knowe that the Popiſhe lawes are againſt them that reuolte twyſe from theyr Religion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:25"/>
            <p>If I returned vnto <hi>Roome</hi> againe, or to the Popes dominions: I ſhould be condemned, eyther to the fire, or to the Gallies. Wherfore I meane to abide in England, hap well or hap yll, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath no fellowe, better it is to liue in pouertie, then to be whipped on the Seas, and to be taught to rowe, hauing therevnto as good towardneſſe, as Tom Collier thy fathers man.</p>
            <p>And where as more impudentlie then an Aſſe thou writeſt: <hi>That the moſt parte of my reportes, touching your treacheries and malicious practiſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queenes Maieſtie, and her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Councell, is vntrue.</hi> If I wrote any thing otherwiſe then the trueth was: why dydſt thou not make mention thereof, that I might haue purged my ſelfe of infamie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth? But I wrote no more then trueth gaue place: but in the booke of Pilgrimage I wyll diſcouer, God wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling more at large, your treaſonable attemptes, againſt the Crowne and dignitie, againſt her honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and againſt her common weale.
<pb facs="tcp:5966:25"/>I haue ſpoken, and doo ſpeake, and wyll ſpeake nothing elſe but trueth of you: But it is as harde a thing to heare trueth of you, as it is for the Pope to giue his Miter away to poore beggers. And finally, where as thou concludeſt thy Lybell with theſe wordes: <hi>That there ſhall neuer want vacabounds and runnagates for gaine.</hi> If thou wylt haue theſe wordes to haue relation to thy ſelfe, and to thy brothers (who in déede are Vacabounds and runnagates from Tauerne to Tauerne, from Towne to Towne, from Shiere to Shiere.) Thou ſayſt well and truely, and I goe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to diſprooue thy wordes: but if thou meaneſt of me, I am no runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, I ſtay in one place, and am not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde to ſhewe my face, in the preſence of you all, if I could tell where to finde you. But you are not farre vnlyke to the théeues, who in the day tyme ſléepe or lurke in Caues, and in the night tyme raunge abroade. I thinke you meete bothe together on the plaines of <hi>Salisburie:</hi> the theefe he ſéeketh but the purſe, but you are not contented
<pb facs="tcp:5966:26"/>with the purſe, but ſeeke to bereaue a man of his body and ſoule. We had more néede by a great deale (if we haue reſpect to the ſafetie of our bodies and ſoules) to take héede that we be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, by the craftie iugling of theſe wandering Popiſh Préeſts.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I aunſwered to euerie particular Article contayned in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Lybell againſt me written, and I thought it good to containe the ſame in this Epiſtle written vnto you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull Company, for this cauſe onely. For that they ſay: <hi>That I attempted many moſt malicious thinges, betweene the Prince of <hi>Orainge,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </hi> If you heare and vnderſtand it of credible perſons, that I was ſuch a fellowe as they report me to be: I deſire you, as not compelled, to make mention thereof in your Letters, and conuay it to <hi>London.</hi> I am ſure and certaine, that there is no man can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch that I was ſuch a fellowe, as they make me to be. I confeſſe my life hath béene wicked and lewde, but neuer ſo wickedlie and lewdlic bent, as the
<pb facs="tcp:5966:26"/>Papiſts doo report. <hi>They ſay, I am irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, I am altogether giuen to vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, God hath forſaken me, there is no hope of my ſaluation.</hi> This is but theyr raſhe iudgement, God forgiue them, I wiſhe them well to doo, God graunt them a penitent heart, and a tongue to ſpeake trueth. I am not the firſt that hath béene wrongfullie ſlaundered, nor ſhall be the laſt.</p>
            <p>There is a Popiſhe Préeſt héere in England, that reported that he knewe him ſelfe, bothe noble men, worſhipfull, and Preachers héere in this Land, to be of the houſeholde of Atheiſme: But as I told, ſo tell I againe, that Papiſts can doo nothing elſe but lye, and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie report.</p>
            <p>I leaue héere to trouble you any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beeing otherwiſe occupied with waightier affayres, then to obtaine fitte opportunitie and leaſure to peruſe this rude Letter of mine.

If your deſire be to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, howe in times paſt liuing in blindneſſe and errour. (Marke heere, I counted the bright &amp; ſhining beames of Chriſt his Goſpell blindneſſe, and the preaching thereof, the preaching of errour,) I ſubuerted, corrupted and prophaned as much as I could, the doctrine of our holie mother the Church, <hi>Scilicet.</hi> If you are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to knowe wherein I haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our holie Father the Pope, and wherin I haue more taſhly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpoken againſt the catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: to obey your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, I did what I could, to put in writing ſuch words as I vſed againſt him and his Religion, and truſting to your

Wherefore, how ſo euer I ſpeake, be not greeued, and turne not therefore your fatherly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from me: the fault is not in me to write the thing commaunded, I write what I ſpake, whiles that I ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in England, and I ſpake as I was taught: nowe I write that which I hate, but ſpake then that which I ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. This is a newe metamorpheſis, of a Collier, to become a Scholler, of a plow-man, a Preacher, and of an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique to become a catholique: there are colliers that haue gon to ſchoole, &amp; haue read there is but one God, one Baptiſme, &amp; one faith in Ieſus chriſt, &amp; why are they not ſchollers? There are plow-men that can teache theyr houſehold, to looue God aboue all things, &amp; to loue one another as god loued vs, and gaue his only begotten
<pb facs="tcp:5966:29"/>ſonne, to reconcile vs vnto him bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enimies, tranſgreſſours of his holie law and commaundement, and are they not Preachers? Heretiques will become catholiques, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and examine the corrupt lyuing of babling Preachers, their vſurping of Eccleſiaſticall liuinges, their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to higher degrees of promotion, their vnſatiable and inordinate coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, their proude and ſtatelie going in ruffian-like apparell, their too much pampering of hungrie gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, their exceſsiue lauiſhneſſe in rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous expences, their vnſtableneſſe of promiſe, their ſwearing and forſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them-ſelues, for the value of a ſtrawe, their wanton and laſciuious ſongs vpon ale-benches: and finally, po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering of their diſſolute behauior, in words &amp; geſture: If they teach the people one thing, and doo an other, what hope can the people haue to be ſaued? what comfort doo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue? what confidence are they bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

            <p>Is it maruaile that the people doo amiſſe, and ſwerue from the trueth? truelie, I am thorowlie perſuaded, that as they are farre from God, in life and conuerſation: ſo farre they are from him in faith and good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: if their Religion ſauoured not of hereſie, would God puniſhe them as he dooth? What contrarietie in Religion is there amongſt them? one

But the other ſayth, no, they haue not the trueth on their ſide: this faith wherevpon we build, this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion wherevnto we truſt, euerie man of what degree ſo euer, high or lowe, poore or ritch, noble or ignoble, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ought to embrace, and gladlie receyue. By this Religion we ſhall be bleſſed, and inherite an euerlaſting crowne of heauenlie glorie. One ſaith, he is a Zwinglian, and an other ſayth, he is an Annabaptiſt, one ſayth he is a Lybertine, and an other ſayth, he is a Puritane, one ſayth, he is a Caluiniſt, and an other ſayth, he is a Lutherane. Good God, howe many Religions be there? if there were many Gods, I would not woonder at their varietie in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:30"/>
            <p>But ſeeing there is but one God, who made all thinges, hath ordayned all thinges in a dewe order, the Sunne to rule by daye, the Moone by night, the earth to bring foorth her encreaſe, and the waters not to paſſe their dewe boundes, who ruleth all thinges, and at whoſe becke all thinges doo appeare, in whome we haue our life, our beeing and eſſence: VVhy ſhould there be ſuch diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie in Religion, ſuch varietie in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, ſuch contrarietie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching our ſaluation? There is but one GOD, there ought to be but one Religion. There is but one trueth, what needeth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſſentions, ſo many contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, and ſo many alterations from the trueth? But their life is ſo wicked and prophane, ſo rechleſſe and lewde, that they wyll haue their Religion correſpondent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their conuerſation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:31"/>
            <p>He that is rocked in the cradle of ſinne and ſecuritie, he that is nuſled in wantonnes, and brought vp in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes, he that is choaked with worldlie cares of this life, he, whoſe bellie is his god, he, whoſe money is his onelie ioye, and he, whoſe land is his onely truſt: regardeth more theſe corruptible &amp; fleeting vanities, then the incorruptible and immutable trea ſures of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie Paradiſe. He, whoſe whole truſt and confidence is in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pleaſures, muſt be depriued of inſenſible delightes.

In verie deede, the life, deedes, and conuerſation of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques doo plainlie ſhewe, that they more abhorre and feare the odious name of an Epicure or Saduceie, then they doo the nature. For what think they the ſoule to be immortall, who liue not farre better then the brutiſh beaſts, which follow nature, but they degenerate from nature, and are by reaſon of their corrupt life, inferiour to the beaſts of the feeld? Be they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that God rewardeth the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heauen, or puniſheth ſinners in hell with endleſſe torments? In euery trifling thing they dread not to violat the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God, and run headlong into ſinne: euen as though they did either thinke that God were but a vaine &amp; fay ned thing, or beleue that when the body dieth, the ſoule likewiſe periſheth, and commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:5966:32"/>to nothing. They liue ſo idle, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ſecure in their callinges: that GOD muſt ſurelie plague them at length, and bring them to confuſion. They reſpect the ſafetie, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their bodies heere on earth, rather then the ſaluation of theyr ſoules, in the kingdome of Chriſt. They rather obey the wordes of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes,</hi> for temporall gaine, then the warning of Chriſt, for eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. Whereby it comes to paſſe, that they haue commonlie fayre bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but deformed ſoules, much goodes, but little goodneſſe: and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious they ſeeme in the ſight of men outwardlie, but odious inwardlie in the eyes of God. For it is harde to finde a man (ſayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) <hi>Lib. 2. Rhet. 1. ad The odetem.

            <p>God will ſurelie one daie be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them, not onely in hell with euerlaſting paine: but alſo in this life with infinit miſeries, and a laborinth of intricate euyls. VVhat doo I ſay? one day, yea, God already for their wickedneſſe and ſliding from our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Mother the Church, hath gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſlie afflicted them, and brought them to extreeme calamities, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe and deſolation? With how many troubles, with how many vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of minde, and with how many ſorrowes, hath God puniſhed the heretiques in Flaunders? for their hautie ſtomackes, and diſloyaltie to their natural King, for their ſtubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in not receiuing clemencie offered vnto them, and for their wilfulnes in reiecting the ſame: for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of the Catholique faith, and for their following, I cannot tell, nor they them ſelues: vvhat Religion, ſo vnſtable and vnconſtant their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, in matters of faith. God hath
<pb facs="tcp:5966:33"/>ſtirred vp the Catholiques againſt them, their ſtrength is feebled, their fayre buildinges made euen with the ground, their coffers are opened, and their gold and ſiluer fyll the purſes of their aduerſaries: their coſtlie houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſtuffe, their hangings, their trim attyre, their cloath of Tiſſue, and whatſoeuer thing elſe they haue, is taken away. Their cattell is driuen from them, their corne is burnt, and in ſumme, they them ſelues, are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iuſtlie made bonde-men and ſlaues, or elſe wretchedlie and ruful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſlaine. So that now after Gods iuſt reuengement, they are become the outcaſt, and the verie ſcum of the earth: they are baniſhed out of their owne countrey, and can finde no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place to reſt: they are a fable vnto all the world for their newe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented hereſies, their ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not far better then the Iewes, and their puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth not much differ the one from the other: the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,
<pb facs="tcp:5966:34"/>and the <hi>Iewes</hi> are hated a lyke, are perſecuted a lyke, and are puniſhed heere in this worlde a lyke. But heerein, the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques doo differre in ſinne: the <hi>Iewe</hi> ſinneth ignorauntlie, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatelie, but Heretiques ſinne not ignorauntlie, but obſtinatelie, and wilfullie. The <hi>Iewes</hi> neuer knewe Chriſte, neuer beleeued in him, nor neuer tooke him to be the ſauiour of the worlde: The Heretiques ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Chriſte to be the onelie begotten ſonne of GOD, beleeued in him, and tooke him to be theyr <hi>Meſsias</hi> or <hi>Ieſuah.</hi> But in ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from the Catholique fayth, they haue loſt the knowledge of Chriſte, their faith is fruſtrate, and in vaine: Their taking of Chriſte to be their ſauiour, can nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle them, can ſtande them in no ſteede.</p>
            <p>And why? they haue denied the Pope to be Supreame head, they
<pb facs="tcp:5966:34"/>haue renounced the Traditions of the Apoſtles, the Councelles they deſpiſe. the aucthorities of the graue and learned Fathers, they diſallowe: and to be breefe, the Lawes of our holie Mother the churche, they haue contempned, and contrary ſayd them.</p>
            <p>VVherefore their ſinne is not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, and more greeuouſlie to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in hell: then the obſtinate ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Chriſte to be theyr redeemer. If this fayth, whereby we hope to be ſaued, which is the Catholique faith, were not the true and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall faith? whereof mention is made in our Creede, where as it is ſayde: <hi>I beleeue in the holie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche.</hi> And what church is this? is it not that, for the which ſo many Martirs, ended their vitall breath, before the due courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:35"/>
            <p>So many in wylderneſſe lead a moſt auſteare life, lyued in penurie and ſcarſitie, glad they were to ſuſtaine their lyues, with rootes and water: they forſooke the world, with all the pompe and gliſtering ſhewes therof, they bridled their carnall affections and ſenſuall luſtes: the deuill with all his ſubtill temptations, they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came with faſting and praier. What? doo they beleeue, that theſe holie Hermites are all condempned, for that they haue beleeued the church of <hi>Roome,</hi> to be the holie catholique Church, and the Pope to be the head and cheefe Sheepheard thereof?</p>
            <p>Haue ſo many Monkes, ſo many Friers erred? who wrought ſo many charitable deedes, ſo often faſted, ſo often prayed, ſo often called vnto God for grace and helpe, ſo brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie exhorted the wicked to amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lyfe, ſo freendlie harboured the harborleſſe, cloathed the naked, fed the hungrie, viſited the ſicke, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb facs="tcp:5966:35"/>the poore priſoners, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the captiues, forſooke their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges, and gaue them ſelues onelie to contemplation.</p>
            <p>VVere all theſe reprobate? doo they all ſuffer tormentes in hell for euer, neuer to enioy the glorious contemplation of Gods heauenlie countenaunce? is this the rewarde which they haue for all their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for their vpright dealinges, for their timerous conſcience to offend their neighbour, and beeing by ſome miſchaunce offended, to aſke him forgiueneſſe, and to render a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? Shall good workes reape no better reward, then among the dampned? ſhould this their reward, be euerlaſtinglie to rue in hell? If, as the heretiques ſay, their faith was Antichriſtian-like, and contrarie to Gods word. Beleeue this who that will, and let him be an heretique therefore: I beleeue they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie men, and for their holineſſe and
<pb facs="tcp:5966:36"/>catholique Religion, were crowned with an incorruptible crowne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall bliſſe, in heauenlie ioye. If the Religion of our holie Mother the Church were nought? then in vaine haue ſo many Saintes ſerued the Lord, honoured him, and kept his commaundementes? in vaine haue ſo many Virgins, intruded them-ſelues to Monaſteries, ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, and eſtraunging them-ſelues from the ſocietie of ſeculer women? in vaine haue they reſerued their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, forſaking wealthy and ritch mariages: in vaine haue they chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their bodies, ſubduing and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to ſubiection? in vaine haue they liued, and in vaine haue they beleeued, if for the confeſsion of the Catholique Church of <hi>Roome,</hi> damnation bothe of body and ſoule ſhould be then their reward? So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Preeſts, ſo many Leuits, ſo many Kinges, ſo many Princes, ſo many Potentates, ſo many Magiſtrates,
<pb facs="tcp:5966:36"/>haue liued in vaine, and in vaine was their faith, who were no happier then the Gentiles in <hi>Cicero</hi> his time, to be condemned with the heathen Gentiles, ſince the beginning of the faith of Chriſte. Onely periſhing in ſoule and bodie, for that their faith depended of the Catholique faith, of our holie Mother the Churche. Empires, Kingdomes, Prouinces, Iſlands, Citties, and Townes, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Church of <hi>Roome,</hi> which is the holy Catholique Church: and are they all condemned therefore? and haue they all liued in blindneſſe, and errour? and hath Chriſte beene ſo vniuſt of his promiſe, neuer to fayle his Church? and haue his woordes beene ſo vntrue, that the holie Ghoſt ſhould direct the Catholique Church in all her dooinges? howe was the Church directed, if all the people erred?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:37"/>
            <p>How ſhould Chriſt beeing the way, the trueth and life, neuer fayle his Spowſe: if he ſuffered her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from him, who is the trueth? Chriſt his wordes are true: <hi>Coelum et terra peribunt, ſed verba eius rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebunt vera in aeternum.</hi> Heauen and earth ſhall periſhe, but his wordes ſhall remaine true for euer.</p>
            <p>Though the heretiques prate, or ſpeake neuer ſo much againſt the trueth, Chriſte hath euermore inſtructed the churche of Roome. Though <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> write to the contrarie, who make them-ſelues more familliar with Chriſte, and more priuie to his ſecretes, then euer the Apoſtles were, who were conuerſant with Chriſte liuing on earth. But <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> not ſo: they make men beleeue that their Forefathers liued in blindneſſe and errour, euen from the time of the Apoſtles, vntyll their
<pb facs="tcp:5966:37"/>dayes. O happie mothers, to be conceyued, and to be deliuered of ſuch fortunate children, and to bring them vp in ſuch good lytterature, that they ſhould become the lampes of the world, the Teachers of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
            <p>I haue written I can not tell what: naie, I ſay, O vnhappie mothers, to haue ſuch vnluckie children, good it had beene for them, and for their children, if they plaide vppon one ſtring, that they neuer had beene borne. Their chyldren were the inſtrumentes of Sathan, to ſeduce the fooliſh and worldlie people, they were the cauſe, why that many loſt their liues vntimelie, heere in this world: As in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> thouſands were ſlaine, in <hi>Germanie</hi> foure ſcore thouſand at once: in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> I knowe not howe many: beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countreyes, infinite was the number of them that were ſlaine,
<pb facs="tcp:5966:38"/>drowned and burnt: I knowe not for what Religion, nor I thinke they them-ſelues knewe, but why they were thus cut of, their pride abated, their mallice aſſwaged, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes confounded: I partlie knowe, it was, for that they denied the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of our holie Father the Pope, God woulde needes giue the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe to his enimies, and graunt victorie to his generall Vicar heere on earth. If his title had not beene good, he had not preuailed thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enimies, he had not ſo often gotten the feelde, and brought his enimies to ſhame and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>VVhat ſhall I ſaye of Englande, my natiue Soyle? it contemneth, deſpiſeth, and little embraceth the trueth, lyttle regardeth the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith: blinde ignoraunce, and a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or a heape of all kinde of hereſies, greatlie there preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
<pb facs="tcp:5966:38"/>Howe many be there that wot not whome to beleeue, whome to call vpon, or what trade of lyfe they ought to leade? VVicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, iniquitie, cogging and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening, and the corruption of this monſtrous Realme, are horrible great: the bleſſed doctrine of God (the onely true foode) nourture, direction, and rule of mans lyfe, is little knowne, little ſet by, and little followed.</p>
            <p>God is long before he puniſheth, but when he commeth: he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth with an iron rodde, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcourgeth them for their ſinnes, vnleſſe they repent, whyle it is tyme. They may looke for the lyke puniſhment, troubles, and myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as were laide vpon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and which they ſuffered deſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for the hardeneſſe of theyr heartes, and for theyr vnbeleefe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:39"/>
            <p>Leaſt that I wearie your chaſte cares (moſt woorthy Cardinalles) with tediouſneſſe, I make an ende, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pardon for my greeuous treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and heynous offence againſt our holy father the Pope, and againſt our holy mother the Church.</p>
            <p>God preſerue your Graces, to the holding vp of his Church, to the vanquiſhing of your enimies, who at the firſt as bubbles of the water, ryſe vp and floriſh for a whyle: then by and by fall downe and appeare no more. Who at the firſt rule the roaſt in many places, as <hi>Arrian</hi> the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique did: but I am affraide, their ende ſhall be as <hi>Arrians</hi> was, if not in this life, yet in the life to come: for <hi>Arrian</hi> auoided his guttes, as he went to auoide the excrementes of his bodie.</p>
            <p>If our heretiques die not thus, yet they may die after a wurſſe ſort. If God in this life plagueth them not,

            <p>The <hi>Pellagians</hi> had a time, and proſpered for a whyle, againſt the Church of <hi>Roome,</hi> but by little and little, their hereſie decaied: The <hi>Marcionistes</hi> fought for a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Roome:</hi> but in continuance of tyme, it got the vpper hand, and the hereſie of the <hi>Marcionistes</hi> was quite forgotten, aboliſht and blotted out.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:5966:41"/>head, and that the Church of Chriſt is neyther in <hi>Roome,</hi> nor in the Capitoll of <hi>Roome:</hi> no more then it is in <hi>Egipt,</hi> or the high pinacled Churches in <hi>Egipt.</hi> But in euerie Nation, and in euerie Countrey, the men that feare God, and worke righteouſnes, they are the houſe of God, they are the Church: Euerie chaſte body is his holy Tabernacle, and ſpirite and trueth is his heauenly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: They are the Church of God, if they doo holde, and ſhall holde, the reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theyr hope, conſtantly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vnto the ende.

            </p>
            <p>In theſe &amp; all ſuch places, we be taught that the houſe of God, is not any buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of wood or ſtones, nor any Cittie, or any materiall Temple: but man is the houſe of God, as héereafter more manifeſtlie it ſhall appeare, when I come to intreate of the Church.</p>
            <p>But firſt I will begin with the Pope, who arrogantlie nameth him ſelfe the vniuerſall Shéepheard. And his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or ſubiectes are not afraide to ſay, that hee béeing Biſhoppe of <hi>Roome,</hi> is the viſible heade of the Churche in Chriſtes ſtéede: But this they cannot ſhewe by Scripture, neyther dooth the Church require any ſuch head, for Chriſte is preſent with it, as he hath
<pb facs="tcp:5966:42"/>promiſed. <hi>Math. 28. <hi>Sum vobiſcum vſque ad conſummationem mundi.</hi> I am with you alwayes, euen vnto the ende of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Pope be a viſible head, why is he not ſéene of all men? why dooth he not gouerne all men in the Churche, and giue nouriſhment vnto them, as the head ought to doo? why dooth he not preach vnto all people? This he dooth not: wherefore he is no viſible head, as he ſeemeth to pretend. And ſurely, to be the generall head ouer all: is too great a matter and enterpriſe for any mortall man to take vpon him.</p>
            <p>I am ſure the Pope wyll graunt him ſelfe to be a member of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche: if he then be a member, howe can hée alſo be an head? except the ſame thing ſhall be bothe an head and a member, which is verie abſurde and monſtrous. If he ſaye that he is a member, Chriſt is his head onely, and not any other: why ſhall not Chriſte be as well a head for all? Theſe thinges we ſée are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie chyldiſhe and fonde, but yet they
<pb facs="tcp:5966:42"/>applie and ſaye, that Chriſt ſayde to <hi>
                  <hi>Peter:</hi> Thou arte <hi>Peter,</hi> and vppon this Rocke wyll I builde my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not preuayle againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe vppon this place, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries the Papiſtes, grounde this propoſition: the Churche is founded vppon Saint <hi>Peter, Ergo,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was the head of the Church. If Saint <hi>Peter</hi> be the head of the Church, the Pope is his ſucceſſour, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope is the head of the Church. I denie that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was head of the Church, and therefore is Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (whoſe ſucceſſour the Pope clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him ſelfe to be) was neuer head of the Church: howe can the Biſhop of <hi>Roome</hi> be head?</p>
            <p>The confeſſion of our aduerſaries is grounded vppon theſe woordes. <hi>Tu es Petrus.</hi> That is to ſaye: <hi>Thou arte Peter.</hi> And ours vppon this. That it is ſayde. <hi>Super hanc Petram, et non ſuper te Petrum.</hi> That is: <hi>Vpon this Rocke, and not vpon thee Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:43"/>
            <p>In déede our ſauiour Chriſte hath moſt manifeſtlie diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Petrum à Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Simon Peter</hi> from the liuelie Rocke wherevpon he hath builded his Church, chaunging bothe the name and the perſon. The which our text plainly ſheweth vs, that which he would neuer haue doone, if it ought to haue béene vnderſtoode of <hi>Peter,</hi> and not of the confeſſion of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leaue it to the iudgement of euerie Chriſtian: whether it be more agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the faith, and more healthfull for the Church, eyther that the Church be founded vpon Chriſte, or vppon <hi>Peter:</hi> vpon the ſonne of the lyuing God, vpon him that vanquiſhed ſathan: or vpon him, whome Chriſte him ſelfe in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame Chapter calleth Sathan him ſelfe. Vpon him who is called the cheefe corner ſtone of the building, or vpon him who is an offence vnto him: that is to ſaye, a ſtone of great ſtumbling.</p>
            <p>None ſayth Saint <hi>Paule 1. <hi>Cor. 3.</hi> Can laye any other foundation, but that which is layde, which is Chriſte.</hi> Alſo Saint <hi>Peter ſayth. <hi>2. Peter. 2.</hi> You are as liuing ſtones, built vpon the cheefe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:5966:43"/>ſtone, in whome who ſo euer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he ſhall not be confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded:</hi> That is to ſay, in that cofeſſion of Chriſt, which he calleth the Rocke and foundation of the Church. It appeareth then by this place, that Chriſte hath builded it vpon him ſelfe, and not vpon <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and vpon the confeſſion of faith which <hi>Peter</hi> made, and not vpon the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> which was too much waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and vnſtedfaſt. And in verie déede, where Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> reciteth this ſtorie, he reſteth whollie vpon <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion. <hi>Iohn. 6.</hi> And therefore by the Rocke, he meant him ſelfe. For when <hi>Peter</hi> had ſayde, <hi>Tu es Christus fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Dei. <hi>Thou art Chriſte the ſonne of God,</hi>
               </hi> Chriſte ſayde to him: <hi>Vpon this Rocke will I builde my Church.</hi> And in that place, he giueth no more to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Keies (which is the binding and looſing of ſinners) then he giueth them all elſe where. As in <hi>Iohn. 20.</hi> when he ſayde, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Firſt, they muſt prooue that <hi>Peter</hi> was chéefe and head of all the Apoſtles: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlie, that hée was at <hi>Roome,</hi> and ſate there as Biſhoppe generall: Thyrdlie, that he left all the title &amp; preheminence, of his ſeate to his ſucceſſours, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.

            <p>For as much then, that neyther by the writinges of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other Apoſtle of Chriſte: our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can prooue the Pope to be any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall head to this Church, but Chriſte Ieſus alone, who is alwayes preſent with it, and euer walketh in the middeſt of the ſeuen golden Candel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes, ſo that hee néedeth no Vicar generall, or vniuerſall Biſhoppe:</p>

            <p>Well, ſhall we haue a view of the Scriptures? ſhall we ſée what in them that Biſhoppe of <hi>Roome</hi> hath, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his <hi>Papacie?</hi> one thing (déerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looued) before I beginne, I dare faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie promiſe you, that you ſhall finde throughout the whole Teſtament, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Papa, Papatus, Primas,</hi> nor <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> Neyther <hi>Pope, Papacie, Primate,</hi> nor <hi>Primacie,</hi> to be graunted vnto any of the Apoſtles of Chriſte, then much leſſe vnto the Biſhop of <hi>Roome.</hi> Howe ſhamefully they wreſt thoſe places of binding and looſing: No learned man there is, but vnderſtandeth and percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſame. I aunſwere with <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine: <hi>De. ſin. Cleri.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God in the perſon of <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> gaue the Keies to all, to ſignifie the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all, for Chriſte did it not for this
<pb facs="tcp:5966:48"/>purpoſe, to preferre one man before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to ſet out the vnitie of the Church: for the reſt of the Apoſtles were the ſame thing that <hi>Peter</hi> was, endued with like partaking, bothe of honour and power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth. <hi>Homil.</hi> in <hi>Iohn. 1. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 11. <hi>Si in Petro Eccleſia mysterium non eſſet, Dominus ei non diceret, Dabo tibi cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:</hi> If there were not in <hi>Peter</hi> a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Church, the Lord would not ſay to him: I will giue thee the Keies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if this was ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> the Church hath them not: but if the Church haue them, then <hi>Peter</hi> when he receyued the Keies, betokened the whole Church. And in an other place, when they were all aſked, onelie <hi>Peter</hi> aunſwered, <hi>Thou arte Chriſte:</hi> And it is ſayde to him, <hi>I will giue thee the Keies.</hi> As though he alone, had receiued the power of binding and looſing: whereas bothe he béeing one ſayd then, one for all, and he receyued the other with all, as bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the perſon of vnitie: therefore one for all, becauſe there is vnitie in all.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5966:49"/>
            <p>Let <hi>Peter</hi> truelie haue the firſt place: yet there is great difference betwéene the honour of degrée, and power. We ſée that the Apoſtles commonly graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this to <hi>Peter,</hi> that he ſhould ſpeake in aſſemblies, and after a certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner goe before them, with propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, exhorting, and admoniſhing: but of his power we reade nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Reade the Scriptures, and there ye ſhall finde, what office and power, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had among the Apoſtles, howe hée behaued him ſelfe, and howe he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of them. Runne ouer all that remayneth written, you ſhall finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that he was one of the twelue, equall with the reſt, and their fellowe, but not their Lord. But to graunt them that which they require, concerning <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, that he was the Prince of the Apoſtles, and excelled the reſt in dignitie: Yet there is no cauſe, why they ſhould of a ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, make an vniuerſall rule, and drawe to perpetuitie, that which was once doone, ſith there is a farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reaſon. One was chéefe among the Apoſtles, forſoothe, becauſe they were
<pb facs="tcp:5966:49"/>fewe in number. If one were the chéefe of twelue men, ſhall it therefore followe, that one ought to be made ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of a hundred thouſand millions of men? It is no meruaile, that twelue had one among them, that ſhould rule them all, for nature beareth this, and the witte of men requireth this, that in euerie aſſemblie (although they be all equall in power) yet there is one as a gouernour, whome the reſt may haue regard vnto. There is no Court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Conſull: no Seſſion of Iudges without a Pretor, or Propounder: no Company without a Ruler: no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe without a Maiſter. So ſhould it be no abſurditie, if we confeſſed, that the Apoſtles gaue to <hi>Peter</hi> ſuch a ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie: but that which is of force among fewe, is by and by to be drawne to the whole world, to the ruling whereof, no one man is ſufficient. But (ſay they) this hath place no leſſe in the whole v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſalitie of nature, then in all the parts, that there be one ſoueraigne head of all. And héereof (very wiſely, as they thinke) they fetch a proofe from Cranes and Bées, which alwayes chuſe to them
<pb facs="tcp:5966:50"/>ſelues one guide and not many. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in déede, the examples which they bring foorth: but doo Bées reſort toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of all the world, to chuſe them one King? euery ſeuerall King is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his owne Hiue. So among Cranes, euery hierde hath theyr owne King. What elſe ſhall they prooue héereby? but that euerie Church ought to haue her owne ſeuerall Biſhoppe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her. But whereas I ſayde, let it be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Prince of the Apoſtles: He was no otherwiſe called Prince of the Apoſtles, then <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> was called Prince of Eloquence, in reſpect of excellencie, not of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: and ſo was <hi>Homer</hi> called, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Poeticall fineneſſe. If a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be mooued, who were the chéefe, and captaine of the ſchoole? Some one or other ſhould be noted foorthwith: yet is hée not therefore a Prince ouer his fellowes, nor his fellowes ſubiect vnto him. So I ſay, though <hi>Peter</hi> had béene called the Prince of the Apoſtles: yet was hée not theyr ſoueraigne and Lord, but fellowe labourer in the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:5966:50"/>his Vineyarde. And thus much bréeflie touching the Pope and his falſe ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</p>

For firſt, if no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſaluation be to be hoped for out of the Church, which Church muſt be without all queſtion, that ſame verie Church of <hi>Roome,</hi> as they frame theyr argumentes, and that the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> be none other, but the ſame which is ſtrained and ſtraighted to the
<pb facs="tcp:5966:52"/>vniuerſall commaundementes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crées of the Biſhoppe of <hi>Roome.</hi> Nowe then they doo exempt out of the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church, not onely this our Engliſh nation: but together with them alſo, they doo exclude out of the number of the Catholique Church, infinite other famous learned Clarks, of the auncient and pure age of the Church, as Doctors, Patriarches, and Biſhoppes, yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe alſo, all the Biſhoppes of <hi>Roome,</hi> as many as were <hi>Gregories</hi> predeceſſors. But what néede many proofes in a matter of it ſelfe ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and well knowne?

Séeing that no mention thereof is made to be ſuch a Church (as the Papiſtes would haue it to be) throughout all the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But we gather by the Scriptures, that the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> is the Church of the deuill: for if the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> were the true Church of Chriſte, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſheepe heare his voice,</hi> But the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> heareth not his voyce, but heareth rather the voyce of Courtezanes: therefore it is not the true Church, but the Sinagogue of Sathan.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> were the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Catholique Church: it would then féede the ſoule of man (béeing a ſpirite) with ſpirituall foode, moone her by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall inſtrumentes, drawe her by the worde, leade her by the ſpirite, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her by the Scriptures, which are the onely meanes which God appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.

The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vſeth no ſuch meanes: wherefore the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> is of

Firſt I will beginne with the Scriptures, as with the veritie it ſelfe: and then with the Doctors, who ground theyr argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and reaſons vpon the worde of God, which is the holy Scripture. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it behooueth man, earneſtly to bende his eyes to conſider, the workes of God. For as much as he is ſet (as it were) in this gorgeous ſtage, to be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of them: yet principallie ought be to bend his eares to the Scriptures,
<pb facs="tcp:5966:59"/>that he may better profite thereby, and ſooner learne the trueth, by the which he may be ſaued. And therefore it is no meruayle, that they which are borne in darkneſſe: doo more and more waxe harde in theyr amazed dulneſſe, becauſe verie fewe of them doo giue them ſelues pliable to learne of the worde of God, whereby to kéepe them within the boundes: but they rather reioyce in theyr owne vanitie.

               <pb facs="tcp:5966:60"/>
               <p>For if we conſider, howe ſlippery an inclination mans minde hath to ſlide into, by forgetfulnes of God, how great a readineſſe to fall into all kinde of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, howe great a luſt to forge often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times new and counterfeyt Religions: <note place="margin">The onely fall of man into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie euyls, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of God.</note> We may thereby perceyue, how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie it was to haue the heauenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſo put in writing, that it ſhould not eyther periſhe by forgetfulneſſe, or growe vaine by errour, or be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by boldneſſe of men. Sith therfore it is manifeſt that God hath alway v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the helpe of his worde, towardes all thoſe whome it pleaſed him at any tyme fruitfully to inſtruct, becauſe he foreſawe, that his Image imprinted in that moſt beautifull forme of the world, was not ſufficiently effectuall: therfore it behooueth vs to trauaile this ſtraight waye, if we earneſtlie couette to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to the true beholding of God, we muſt I ſaye, come to his worde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is well and liuelie ſet out by his workes, when his workes be weyed, not after the peruerſeneſſe of our owne iudgement, but according to the rule of the eternall trueth. If we ſwerue
<pb facs="tcp:5966:60"/>from that worde (as I ſayd euen nowe) although we runne neuer ſo faſte: yet we ſhall neuer attayne to the marke, becauſe the courſe of our running is out of the way. For thus we muſt thinke, that the brightneſſe of the face of God, which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>(Rom. 16.)</hi> ſuch, as can not be attained vnto, is vnto vs lyke a Maze, out of which we can not vnwrappe our ſelues, vnleſſe we be by the line of the worde, guided into it.

The ſame meaning hath the .xix. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> where the Prophet hauing preached, <hi>Of the voice of God, which in thunder, winds, ſhowers, whirle-winds and ſtormes, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb facs="tcp:5966:61"/>the earth, maketh the mountaines to tremble, and breaketh the Ceder trees:</hi> In the ende, at laſt he goeth farther, and ſayth. <hi>That his prayſes are ſung in the Sanctuarie, becauſe the vnbeleeuers are deafe, and heare not all the voices of God that reſound in the ayre.</hi> And in lyke manner, in an other <hi>Pſalme. 93.5.</hi> after that he had deſcribed, <hi>the terrible waues of the ſea:</hi> He thus concludeth, <hi>Thy teſtimonies are verified, the beautie of thy Temple is holineſſe for euer.</hi>

               <p>And out of this meaning alſo proceeded, that which Chriſte ſayde to the woman of <hi>Samaria. <hi>Iohn. 4.22.</hi> That her Nation and the reſt, did honour that which they knewe not, and that onely the Iewes did worſhippe the true God.</hi> For whereas the witte of man (by reaſon of the féeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof) can by no meanes attaine vnto God, but béeing holpen and lyfted vp by his holie worde: It followed of neceſſitie that all men, except the <hi>Iewes,</hi> did wander in vanitie &amp; errour, becauſe they ſought God without his worde.</p>

               <p>Howe where the Papiſtes affyrme, that ſinnes are not forgiuen, but with an intent of confeſſing, firmelie concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that the gate of Paradiſe is ſhut againſt him that neglecteth occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered, when he may be conſeſſed: God forhid that we ſhould graunt them that, for there is no other forgineneſſe of ſinnes, then alway hath héene. It is not read, that all they who haue confeſſed theyr ſinnes, in the eare of ſome Préeſt, that they haue onely therefore obtained forgiueneſſe of ſinnes at Chriſtes hand: And truely they could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, where there were neyther Préeſtes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, nor any confeſſing at all. And in many ages after, this confeſſion was vnheard of, at which time, ſinnes were forgiuen without this condition. But that we may not néede to diſpute longer about this, as about a doubtfull matter: the word of God is plaine, which aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for euer: <hi>Whenſoeuer the ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth</hi> (ſayth Chriſt, by the Prophete <hi>Ezechiel.

And it is a meruaile that they doo ſo boldlie frame to them ſelues ſuch principles, as no man in his right witte wyll graunt. They boaſt that the office of binding and looſing, is committed to them, as though it were a certaine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ioyned with Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, theyr whole doctrine cryeth out: that this aucthority was vnknown to the Apoſtles: Neither dooth it belong to the Préeſt, but to him which deſireth abſolution, to knowe certainly whether the ſinner be looſed or not. For as much as he that heareth, can neuer knowe whether the reckoning be iuſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo ſhould there be no abſolution, but ſuch as is reſtrained to his words, that is, to be iudged. The Lord crieth out by <hi>Eſai. Chap. 43.15. <hi>It is I, It is I, that doo put away iniquities, for mine owne ſake, and will not be mindfull of thy ſinnes.</hi>
                  </hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſpeake of Faith, for as much as it importeth not onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confidence which we haue in God: but in as much as it includeth alſo with that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, the very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, wheron dependeth, Faith, Hope, and Charitie, according to the iudgement of Saint <hi>Paule. Hebr. 11.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Faith is the ground of thinges which are hoped for, and the euidence of things which are not ſeene.</hi> Therefore Faith is not (as many doo thinke) a certayne obſcure lyght of God, and a certayne trifling and friuolous opinion: but it is an euident lyght, a certayntie and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the minde, and a cléere ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which béeing our guide, we ſée that God is ſo mightie, wiſe and good, that he can, that he knoweth howe, and that he wyll ſaue vs. Therefore, with a ſure and ſtedfaſt confidence, we put our truſt in him, repoſe and caſt our
<pb facs="tcp:5966:74"/>ſelues whollie vpon him. <hi>Faith is the ſheeld, wherewith we quench all the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dartes of the wicked. <hi>Ephe. 6.16.</hi>
                  </hi> And againe: <hi>Faith is the mouth, bellie and ſtomacke, by the which we feede on the body and blood of Chriſte, beeing at the right hand of his Father in heauen. <hi>Iohn. 6.56.57.</hi>
                  </hi> And againe: <hi>Faith is the ladder that reacheth vp to heauen, and by which euen nowe, we remayne and ſitte in the heauenly places with Chriſt. <hi>Ephe. 2.6.</hi> Faith is the hand by which we take holde of Chriſte, in whome is performed all the promiſes of God to his elect. <hi>2. Cor. 1.20:</hi> Faith is that weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by which we ouercome the world, the end wherof is the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſoules. Faith is a cleare and effectual perſuaſion, wrought, not in the bodily eares, but in the eares of the heart, not by men, but by the holy ghoſt, wherby we are made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſure to be the ſonnes of God. Faith</hi> (as it is written in the. <hi>8.</hi> Cha. to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi>) <hi>is a firme, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant, and perſeuering truſt, in the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifulnes of God. Faith is a lyght, which lyfteth vp, &amp; rauiſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all ſenſible things, and beyond that any man is not able to make diſcourſe.
<pb facs="tcp:5966:75"/>to comprehende the breadth, length, height, and depth of thoſe things which are to vs incomprehenſible with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eyes. Faith is a cleere eye of the mind, wherewith, pearcing through the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, we doo ſee the diuine ſecretes of God. Faith is a quickening, cleere and fiery lyght, which purgeth our heartes and delyuereth vs from the darke and inextricable Laborinthes of the vaine ſhadowes of this worlde: by which we guide our blinde reaſon, and are lyfted vp to an high eſtate: ſo that by the taſte of heauenly thinges, we deſpiſe humane thinges. <hi>Roma. 4.</hi> Faith maketh vs to conceiue Chriſte ſpirituallie, and by force of the ſpirite to be borne againe, with lyfting vs vp vnto God: it maketh vs put of the olde Adam and his concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, and to put on Chriſte with his vertues, and to become of vngodlie, iuſt temples of God, and his chyldren, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and members of Chriſte. Faith iuſtifieth, pacifieth the minde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, maketh merie, cauſeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and in ſuch ſort, that we glory euen in ſhame.</hi> This faith is ſuch, that it reneweth vs, regenerateth vs, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth,
<pb facs="tcp:5966:75"/>maketh noble, enritcheth, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, ſanctifieth, preſerueth, defendeth, and obteyneth that which it demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Faith knitteth vs to God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs his heyres and Children, the brothers of Chriſte, and his members, yea, it maketh vs diuine and happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith is that which in <hi>Abell</hi> made him offer Sacrifices, acceptable to God: In <hi>Noe,</hi> cauſed him to frame the Arke, for the ſauegarde of the worlde: Made <hi>Sara</hi> to conceyue, and that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> offred his owne ſonne to God: Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to worke ſo many woonders in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and in the wylderneſſe. Faith made the Prophets to ſpeake, looſed the tongue of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and ſaued men in daunger: made <hi>Simeon,</hi> not to feare death: alſo, made <hi>Paule</hi> to wiſhe for it.</hi> This in the Saintes cauſed them (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming the world) that they haue wrought woonderfull thinges, through looue.</p>
               <p>But what néede I ſpeake any more? Faith is a vertue, ſo noble, excellent, and woorthy, that howe much the more a man conſidereth of it: ſo much the more wyll it diſcouer the perfection.
<pb facs="tcp:5966:76"/>Therefore, he which hath taſted it, wyll neuer be ſatiſfied, with ſpeaking in prayſe thereof. Whereas thoſe which neuer haue felt, nor tried it in them ſelues, can as much ſpeake thereof, as one that is blinde can diſcerne of coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, yea, if thoſe ſpeake of it, as thoſe which be carnall and brutiſhe: they doo not vnderſtand it, nor knowe the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie thereof.</p>
               <p>He that hath this liuely Faith, wherof the ſcripture, in ſundry places ſpeaketh, and ſo highlie commendeth, with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tytles, before ſpecified: he is ſure to be iuſtified, he is ſure to be ſaued. <hi>This faith made <hi>Abraham</hi> righteous. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. By this faith, the iuſt lyueth. <hi>Haba. 2.4.</hi>
                  </hi> This faith made the woman whole, to whome Ieſus ſayde: <hi>Confide filia, fides tua ſaluam te fecit. <hi>Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To him giue all the Prophetes wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <hi>That through his name, all that beleeue in him, ſhall receyue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſinnes. <hi>Actes.</hi> 10.43.</hi> And put no difference betwéene vs, and them, after that by fayth, hee had purified theyr heartes.</p>
               <p>There is no dyfference: <hi>For all haue ſinned,</hi> (Sayth Saint <hi>Paule. <hi>Roma. 3.23.</hi>
                  </hi>) <hi>and are depriued of the glorie of GOD: and are iuſtified freelie, by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſte Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore wée conclude, that a man is iuſtified by Faith, without the workes of the Lawe: but to him that worketh not, but beléeueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngodlye, his Faith is coumpted for ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wée béeing iuſtified by Faith, wée haue peace towards God, through Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Knowe that a man is not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, by the workes of the Lawe, but by the Fayth of Ieſus Chriſte:
<pb facs="tcp:5966:77"/>Euen as I ſaye, we haue beleeued in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, that we might be iuſtified by the faith of Ieſus Chriſte, and not by the workes of the Lawe: <hi>Becauſe that by the workes of the Lawe, no fleſh ſhall be iuſtified. <hi>Gala. 2.16.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, if righteouſneſſe be by the law, then Chriſte dyed without a cauſe: And that no man is iuſtified by the lawe, in the ſight of God, it is euident: <hi>For the iuſt ſhall liue by faith. <hi>Gala. 3.</hi> By grace are ye ſaued through faith,</hi> Sayth <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Ephe. <hi>2.8.</hi>
                  </hi> and that not of your ſelues, it is the gifte of God. The ſcripture hath included all vnder ſinne, that the promiſe by the faith of Ieſus Chriſte, ſhould be giuen to them that beléeue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origene</hi> writeth, in his thirde Booke, and third Chapter, to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> by theſe wordes: <hi>A rbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramur enim iuſtificari hominem abſque o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus legis: <hi>We ſuppoſe therfore, that man is iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the lawe.</hi>
                  </hi> Affyrmeth that the iuſtification, <hi>Solae fidei, <hi>Of faith onely:</hi>
                  </hi> is ſufficient, ſo that any man beléeuing onely, can be iuſtified: although no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:5966:77"/>of worke hath béene fulfilled, or done by him. And if we require an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who was iuſtified <hi>(Sola fide) <hi>By faith onely,</hi>
                  </hi> without workes: I ſuppoſe that the ſame Théefe dooth ſuffiſe, who when he was crucified with Chriſte, did crye vnto him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe: <hi>Lord Ieſu, remember me when thou commeſt into thy kingdome.</hi> Neither any good worke of his is deſcribed, or ſet foorth vnto vs in the Goſpels: but for <hi>(Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c ſola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>This faith onely.</hi>

But the ſcriptures wrote nothing of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and if there had béen ſuch a place, no
<pb facs="tcp:5966:88"/>doubt, but there had béene mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made therof. <hi>Chriſoſt.</hi> in. <hi>22.

<pb facs="tcp:5966:89"/>that we ſhall be in, after our departing out of this lyfe. <note place="margin">In the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no mention made of praying for the dead.</note> But where dooth the Goſpell ſpeake one iote onely, of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and oblations for the dead? there we doo learne, that they that beléeue and are baptized, ſhall be ſaued, and they that beleeue not, ſhall be condempned. There we reade in the. <hi>7.</hi> Chapter of Saint <hi>Mathevv: <hi>Of the ſtraight and narrowe way, that leadeth vnto ſaluation: and of the wide gate and broade way, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto damnation.</hi>
                  </hi> Not one onely ſillable can be found there of any thyrde way, or of any other eſtate that we ſhall be in, beſides ſaluation and dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after that we be come to our wayes ende. Which thing <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> him ſelfe, in his ſecond Sermon, <hi>De Lazaro,</hi> dooth teach moſt plainly, ſaying: <hi>Para ad exitum opera tua, et appara te ad viam, ſi quid cui rapuiſti, redde, et dicito iuxta Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeum, do quadruplum ſi quid rapui. Si cui factus es inimicus, reconciliare priuſquam veniatur ad iudicem. Omnia hic diſſolue, vt citra molestiam illud videas tribunal.

                  <pb facs="tcp:5966:89"/>That is to ſay: <hi>Prepare thy workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ende, make thy ſelfe ready to the way: if thou haſt taken away any thing from any man, reſtore it againe, and ſay with <hi>Zachaeus,</hi> if I haue taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing from any man, I doo giue it him againe fourefolde. If thou be made an enimie to any man, be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto him againe, afore ye come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudge. Paie all thy debtes heere, that thou mayſt without any feare, or trouble of conſcience, ſee that dreadfull iudgement ſeate. Whiles we be yet here, we haue a goodly hope, but as ſoone as we be once departed hence, it lyeth no more in vs, for to repent, nor for to waſh away our ſinnes.</hi> This holy Father then, wyll not that we ſhould tarie to make reſtitution, or to be reconciled vnto thoſe, whome we haue offended, tyll we be dead. For then ſayth he: <hi>I meane after we be once departed out of this world, there is no way at all to waſh away ſinnes.</hi> In ſo much that he ſayth in an other place. <hi>Neque qui in praeſenti vita peccata non abluerit, postea conſolatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem aliquam inuenturus est in inferno, enim ait, quis confitebitur tibi? et meritò

For ſayth he, who ſhall praiſe thee in hell, and for a good cauſe, for this is the tyme of ſcaffoldes, conflictes, wraſtlinges, and battayles: but after this lyfe, is the tyme of recompences, crownes, and rewardes.</hi>
                  </hi> Howe can it after this lyfe, be the tyme of crownes, and rewardes: if we be caſt into a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire, which is nothing differing from the fire of hell? (ſaue onely that this euerlaſting, and the other laſteth but for a tyme,) there to abide intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable torments, tyll we be holpen out, by the prayers &amp; oblations of the liuing, <note place="margin">A good and kinde deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh preeſts.</note> &amp; eſpecially of the Préeſtes, which muſt be hyred with good ready money to doo it, elſe they will ſuffer vs to abide there, broyling &amp; roſting vnto the worlds end: For, that ye may be ſure, no peny, no <hi>Pater noster,</hi> of them. So that I luſt héere to make an exclamation with the Poet, <hi>Quid non mortalia pectora cogit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ſacra fames?</hi> Which we may engliſhe
<pb facs="tcp:5966:90"/>after this ſort: <hi>Oh of money, looue moſt execrable, that mans heart dooſt ſo ſore enflame.</hi> Oh gréedy deſire of minde, ſo myſerable, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woonders dooſt vndertake to thy great ſhame. Put away offering then, take away Purgatory: For when the Préeſts can get no money, then can they not defend Purgatorie, giue them pence, then wyll they finde ſome ſhifte or other, to prooue that there is Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: yea, and that proofe they will fetch out from the example of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who prayed for his mother, yea, and left in his writing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there was Purgatory. But when S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſéeketh to prooue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, he dooth not bring one iote or ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of the holy ſcriptures, for to prooue his ſayings by: but groundeth him ſelfe only vpon the Forefathers. I will be ſo bolde to follow his owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, which he giueth in the Prologue of his thirde booke, <hi>De Trinitate.</hi> Saying: <hi>Noli meis ſcriptis, quaſi canonicis inſeruire, ſed in illis quod non credebas, ſi forte inueneris, incun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter crede: in iſtis autem, quod certum non habebas niſi certum intellexeris, noli firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter credere. <hi>I wyll not haue thee to be obedient vnto my writinges, as vnto
<pb facs="tcp:5966:91"/>the Canonicall ſcriptures: But if thou dooſt by chaunce finde in them</hi>
                  </hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Canonicall Scriptures) <hi>the thing that thou diddeſt not beleeue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it immediatly, and without any delay: But in theſe</hi> (vnderſtanding thereby his owne workes,) <hi>excepte thou dooſt vnderſtand, that thing to be moſt certayne, which thou diddeſt not recken to be certaine: I wyll not haue thee to beleeue it ſtedfaſtly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a goodly counſaile is this? héere all men may ſée, that this holy Father, wyll not haue his writinges to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, except they be grounded vpon the ſcriptures and word of God. Shall then any man blame vs, if we doo as he him ſelfe dooth bid and counſayle vs to doo? Dooth not all the world knowe, that this auncient Doctour, and moſt holie Father, dyd as a man, writte many thinges, which he was fayne to reuoke and call backe afterwards in his booke of <hi>Retractions?</hi> If he wrote any thing in defence of Purgatorie, he diſprooued the ſame afterwardes, as by his owne wordes it dyd appeare, in the. <hi>18.</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>De verbis Domini:</hi> Theſe be his
<pb facs="tcp:5966:91"/>very words. <hi>Duae quippe habitationes ſunt vna in igne aeterno, altera in regno aeterno. <hi>There be two habitations, or dwelling places, the one in the fire euerlaſting, and the other in the kingdome, that neuer ſhall haue ende.</hi>
                  </hi> Dooth not this agrée wel with the doctrine of our ſauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that dooth onely appoint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is to ſay, the ſocietie and fellowſhippe of all them that died in the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> into the which, the poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> was caried by the handes of the Angels: and hell fire, where the ritch glutton was buried unmediatly after his death?

                  </hi> Againe, in an other place he ſayth: <hi>It ſhould be beſt, that they ſhould affyrme nothing, in a matter that is vncertaine, of that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doo not onely holde their peace: but alſo doo ſpeake the contrarie.</hi> Yet the Papiſts (for lucres ſake) are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to defend the opinion of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, by the fanſies and dreames of theyr owne heads. They that die in the faith of Chriſte, in true confeſſion, and acknowledging theyr ſinnes, and with a true repentant heart, haue no néede af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be once dead, &amp; gone out of this vale of miſerie, of the deuotion and good déedes of theyr fréendes and kinſfolkes.

Ciprian <hi>De coena Domini.</hi> Our abyding, and incorporation in him, is our eating and drinking, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we be vnited vnto Chriſte, and made his body, not by any corporall, but by a ſpirituall manner, paſsing into vs, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſte ſayde to his Diſciples: <hi>Take yee, and eate yee, this is my body, which is giuen for you: doo this as often as yee ſhall doo it, in remembraunce of me.</hi> What can be more euident, then the interpretation of this Supper, if the cyrcumſtances of the wordes, be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned accordingly? For who is ſo blinde that can not diſcerne the fruites of the Lordes death and Paſſion, to be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſignified héere? For as much as in the verie eating, him ſelfe ſayth: <hi>This is my body, that is giuen to be ſlaine for you.</hi> Otherwiſe, why ſhould he haue added with all, <hi>Giuen to be ſlaine:</hi> But that hée woulde ſet downe a plaine teſtimonie of the death of his body, rather then of any ſubſtaunce thereof, to the viewe of the Diſciples?
<pb facs="tcp:5966:97"/>As if he ſhould ſay: <hi>The tyme is nowe at hand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, woorthy to be had in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of all men.</note>
                  <hi>wherein my body muſt be giuen to be ſlaine for you, not for any of mine offence at all, but for your ſakes, which death of mine ſhall procure euerlaſting lyfe for you. After lyke ſort and manner as this bread, which I giue thus broken vnto you to eate, dooth paſſe into your bodies, and giue nouriſhment thereto: Take ye therefore this bread, this bread which I giue to euerie of you, and eate, and withall conſider heerein, not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bread which feedeth your bodies outwardly: But my body which beeing giuen to be ſlaine and crucified for you, ſhall inwardly, and much more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, refreſh you to eternall lyfe. For my fleſhe, which I will giue to be ſlaine for the lyfe of the worlde, is meate in deede, and my blood is drinke in deede. <hi>Iohn. 6.</hi> For your bodies doo not ſo much lyue, by the nouriſhment of meate and drink, as your ſoules be fedde within, with the crucifying of my fleſh, and the ſhedding of my blood: without which you can haue no remiſsion of ſinnes, no ioyfull reſurrection of your fleſhe, no parte or portion of eternall lyfe. Therefore, let
<pb facs="tcp:5966:97"/>this which is giuen you in this Supper, remaine for a perpetuall Sacrament, and remembraunce vnto you, of the body which I will heereafter giue for you. For I ſhall giue my body for you into the handes of enimies, the Sacrament wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doo heere giue into your handes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby you may perceyue (déerely belooued) that héere be two things giuen by Chriſte, one vnto vs, the other for vs: the firſt to be eaten, the laſt to be crucified: that one in the Supper, this other vpon the Croſſe, Now, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the ſubſtance of that which was giuen in the Supper, it was bread, and the Sacrament of his body: That which was giuen vpon the Croſſe, was his body, and not a Sacrament. What then wyll you ſay? was not his body giuen at Supper? yes in déede, Chriſtes body was giuen there to the Diſciples, neither after a bodily and corporall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for that corporall body was giuen to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> not in the Supper, but on the Croſſe, wherevpon he gaue his body corporally, not to the Diſciples, but for the Diſciples. Therefore that which he gaue for his Diſciples, was his body:
<pb facs="tcp:5966:98"/>that which he gaue to his diſciples, was the miſtery of his body, yet was it one &amp; the ſelfe ſame body, bothe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the ſupper giuen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diſciples: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the croſſe giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his Diſciples, but yet not after the ſame ſort, nor yet at the ſame tyme. For vpon the Croſſe it was giuen to be ſlaine corporally: in the ſupper it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to be ſlaine, but to be eaten, not corporally, to be grawne w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> theyr téeth, but to féede vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it in the bowels of their ſoules: namely, after a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal kinde of receyuing, not corporall. Therefore, it is not denied that the Lordes body was bothe giuen &amp; eaten in the Supper? but not the body only, but together with the body, the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t annexed alſo withal: wherof the one apperteyneth to the fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the bodies, the other, to the ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſoules. That which is recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued within in the ſoule, is the very body, not the Sacrament of his body. For as much therfore as theſe two doo neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurre together in the holy ſupper, that the one can not be ſeuered from the other: let vs ſo ioyne the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we neyther ſeperate the body of Chriſte from the Sacrament, as the
<pb facs="tcp:5966:98"/>Papiſts doo (which be ſo throughly wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the only ſubſtance of the body, as that they leaue therin no ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at all of a Sacrament, but ſuperficial and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall ſhadowes: I know not what, hanging in the ayre, which ſerue to no purpoſe:) Neyther let vs ſo ſegregate the Sacrament againe from the body, as that wée leaue nothing in the holy Supper but bare ſignes. <hi>Cyrill, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the. 11.</hi> Dooſt thou pronouce</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>this our ſacrament to be mans foode, and vrgeſt the mindes of the faithfull irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſlie, to groſſe and carnall thoughts? and dooſt thou practiſe to diſcuſſe by mans ſenſuall reaſon, the thinges which are conceiued, by onely and moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite faith?</hi> Heare what Chriſte ſayth in the interpretation of his owne ſpéeche. <hi>Caro</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>non prodest quicquam, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba mea ſpiritus et vita ſunt: <hi>Fleſhe dooth not profit at all, my wordes be ſpirit and life.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:5966:99"/>heare dayly, called by this or that name: when as in very deede they be not made the things wherof they beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names.

If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they ſay, that election giueth vertue to the word, then I prooue the worde of no vertue, &amp; then how can they make God with it? If they ſay, that the worde giueth vertue to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: then I prooue that all men, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the worde, may doo as much in it, as they: For the worde taketh effect in the ſpirite, and not in the fleſhe: this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can not be denied, except they make God parciall.

               <p>Oh crafty Iuglers, God made the world in ſire dayes, and reſted the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day: he made Sunne, Moone and ſtarres: he made byrds, beaſts, fowles, and fiſhes, woormes, ſerpentes, ſtones, hearbes, graſſe, and euerie thing of the ſame worde: and the ſame words wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he made all theſe thinges, doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne

               <p>Nowe to come to the word that they make God of, that is, <hi>Hoc est corpus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which is to ſay: <hi>This is my body.</hi>

The Papiſts ſay that they are iuſtified by good woorkes and not by faith. We ſay that <hi>Sola fides iuſtificat omnes: <hi>Faith alone iuſtifieth all men.</hi>
                  </hi> It is marueilous (dearely beloued) to ſee with what raſhnes and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe iuſtification of woorkes is commonly debated: yea, and it is to be ſeene, how none doe more boldly or with fuller mouthes (as the ſaying is) prate of the righteouſneſſe of workes, then they that are monſtrouſly ſicke of open outward diſeaſes, or be redy to burſt with inward vices: That commeth to paſſe, becauſe they thinke not vpon the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, wherof (if they had neuer ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle feeling) they would neuer make ſo great a mockerie of it. And truely it is out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure lightly regarded, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſuch and ſo perfect, that nothing be imputed vnto it, but euery way whole &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:5966:108"/>abſolute, and defiled with no vncleanneſſe, ſuch as neuer was and neuer ſhal be able to be found in man.</p>
               <p>It is in deede eaſie and readie for euery man in ſchooles to talke vainlie vpon the worthineſſe of woorkes to iuſtifie men, but when they come into the ſight of God, ſuch dalliances muſt auoyd, becauſe there is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt doing vſed, and no trifling ſtrife aboute wordes.

How much more ſhall they that dwell in houſes of clay, &amp; that haue an earthly foundation, be conſumed with mothes? They ſhalbe cut down from the morning to the euening.

               </p>
               <p>I graunt in deed that in the book of Job, is mention made of a righteouſneſſe that is higher then the keeping of the Law, and it is good to vnderſtand this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe although a man did ſatiſfie the Law: yet hee
<pb facs="tcp:5966:109"/>could not ſo ſtand to the triall of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that paſſeth all ſenſes. Therfore although Iob bee cleane in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet hee is amazed and not able to ſpeake, becauſe he ſeeth that the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelike holineſſe cannot appeaſe GOD, if hee exactly way their woorkes. But I therefore will at this time ouerpaſſe that righteouſneſſe which I haue ſpoken of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is incomprehenſible: but onely this I ſay, that if our life bee examined by the rule of the written law, wee are more then ſenceleſſe, if ſo many curſes wherewith the Lord hath willed vs to be awaked do not tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment vs with horrible feare, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this general curſe, <hi>Curſed is euerie one that doth not abide in all the thinges that are written in the booke.</hi> Finally all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhalbe but vnſauery and colde, vnleſſe euery man yeeld himſelfe guiltie before the heauenly Iudge, and willingly throwe downe and abace himſelfe, beeing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full howe hee may bee acquited to this, to this I ſay, we ſhoulde haue lifted up our eyes to learne rather to tremble for feare, then vainely to reioyce. Indeed, eaſie it is, ſo long as the compariſon extendeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then men, for euery man to thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:5966:109"/>to haue ſomewhat, which other oughte not to deſpiſe, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we riſe vp to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto God: then ſuddenly that confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce falleth to the ground &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to naught, &amp; in the ſame caſe altogether is our ſoule in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God: as mans bodie is in reſpect of the heauen. For the ſight of the eye, ſo long as it continueth in viewing thinges that bee neere vnto it, doeth ſhewe of what pearcing force it is, but if it be once directed vp to the ſunne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being daſeled and dulled with the too great brightneſſe thereof, it feeleth no leſſe feeblenes of it ſelfe in beholding of the ſame, then it receiued ſtrength in beholding inferior things. Therfore let vs not deceiue our ſelues with vayne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, although we cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our ſelues either equal or ſuperior to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is nothing to God, by whoſe wil this knowledge is to be tried. But if our wildnes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be tamed with theſe admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he will anſweare to vs as hee ſaide to the Phariſies in <hi>Luke 16.15. You bee they that iuſtifie your ſelues before men: but that which is high to men is abhominable to God.</hi> Now goe thy way and proudly boaſt of thy righteouſnes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, while God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen abhorreth it, but what ſay the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of of God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are truely inſtructed w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his ſpirit?

                  <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruaunt, becauſe euery liuing man ſhall not be iuſtified in thy ſight.</hi> Another ſaith, <hi>Although in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diuers meaning, man cannot be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with God, if he wil contende with him, hee ſhall not bee able to aunſweare one for a thouſande.</hi> Here we now plainly perceiue what is the righteouſnes of God, euen ſuch as can be ſatiſfied with no workes of men, to whom when bee examineth vs of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand offences, we cannot purge our ſelues of one. Such a righteouſneſſe had the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God <hi>Paule</hi> conceiued, when he profeſſed that he knew himſelfe giltie in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that he was not therby iuſtified, And not only ſuch examples are in the holie Scriptures, but alſo all godly wryters doe ſhew that they were alway of this mind.

               <p>And <hi>Bernard ſuper Cant. 6. And in deed
<pb facs="tcp:5966:110"/>where is ſafe and ſtedfaſt reſt and aſſurednes for the weake: but in the woundes of the ſauiour? And ſo much the ſurer I dwell therein, as he is mightier to ſaue. The world rageth, the body burdeneth, the deuill lyeth in wayte: I fall not, becauſe I am buylded vpon the ſure rock, I haue ſinned a greeuous ſinne, my conſcience is troubled, but it ſhall not bee ouer troubled, becauſe I ſhall remember the woundes of the Lord.</hi> And hereupon afterwardes he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth: <hi>Therefore my merite, is the Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of mercie, I am not vtterly without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo long as he is not vtterly without mercy. But if the mercies of the Lord be many, then I alſo haue as many merites. Shal I ſing mine owne righteouſnes? for that is alſo my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, for he is made vnto me righteouſneſſe of God.</hi>

                  </hi> Ser. <hi>15. This is the whole merite of man, if he put his whole hope in him that ſaueth whole man. Likewiſe wher retaining Peace to him ſelfe he leaueth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to God. To thee (ſayth he) let glorie remain vndiminiſhed: it ſhal be wel with me if I haue peace. I forſweare glorie altogether, leaſt if I wrongfully take vpon me that which is not mine owne: I loſe alſo that which is offred me.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5966:111"/>And more plainly in another place he ſaith, <hi>in Cant. ſer. 13. <hi>Why ſhould the Church be careful of merits, which hath a ſurer and ſafer way to glory vpon the purpoſe of God?</hi>
                  </hi> So there is no cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt aſke by what merits we hope for good things, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou heareſt in the prophet, <hi>I wil do it, not for your ſakes, but for mine owne ſake, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It ſuffiſeth for merites, to know that merites ſuffice not. But as it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſeth of merite not to preſume of merite, ſo to be without merits, ſuffiſeth to iudgement. Whereas he frely vſeth this word merites for goood works, we muſt therein bear with the cuſtome, but in the end his purpoſe was to make hipocrits afrayd, that wildly range with licentiouſneſſe of ſinning againſte the grace of God, as afterward hee expoundeth himſelfe ſaying, <hi>Happie is the Church that neither wanteth merites without preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor preſumption without merites.</hi> It hath whereupon to preſume, but not merites. It hath merites, but to deſerue, not to preſume, therfore it preſumeth ſo much the more bold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it preſumeth not, hauing large matter to glorie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen the many mercies of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This is the trueth, the exercyſed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

For that ſhalbe a moſt ſeuere examination, that ſhall pearce into the moſt hidden thoughtes of the heart.

But what? is he acquited by his blindneſſe? no: But</hi> (as hee further ſaieth in the ſame place) <hi>the Lorde wayeth the hearts,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>while man flattereth him ſelfe by reaſon of the outwarde viſor of righteouſneſſe that hee beareth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance: In the meane time the Lord with his ballance examineth the hidden vncleannes of the heart.</hi>

               <p>Therefore ſeeing we ſee nothing profite with ſuch flatterers, let vs not wilfully mock our ſelues to our own deſtruction. But that we may traine our ſelues rightly, wee muſt neceſſarily call backe our conſcience to the iudgement ſeate of God. For we doe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neede his light to diſcloſe the ſecrete foldinges of our peruerſneſſe, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lie too deeply hidden. For then, and neuer till then, wee ſhall cleerelye perceiue what is meant hereby, that man being rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe, and a worme, abhominable &amp; vaine, which drinketh wickednes as water, is far from being iuſtified before God. For who
<pb facs="tcp:5966:113"/>ſhould make that cleane that is conceiued of vncleane ſeede? not one man. Then ſhall we alſo finde that by experience, which <hi>Iob</hi> ſayd of him ſelfe, chapter <hi>19. <hi>St iuſtificare me vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luero, os meum condemnabit me: ſi innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem oſtendero, prauum me comprobabit.</hi> If I will goe about to ſhew my ſelfe innocent, my own mouth ſhall condemne me: If I wil ſhew my ſelfe righteous, it wil prooue me wicked.</hi> For that is not meant of one age onely, but of all ages, which the Prophet in old time, of Iſrael, <hi>that all went aſtray like ſheepe, that euery one turned aſide to his owne way.</hi> For he there comprehendeth all them, to whom the grace of redemption ſhould come, and the rigorouſneſſe of this examination ought to proceede ſo far, till it ſubdue vs, ſo that we be fully throwen downe with all, and by that meane, prepare vs to receiue the grace of Chriſt. For he is deceiued that thinketh himſelfe able to receiue the enioying of this grace, vntill he haue firſt throwen downe all hautineſſe of minde.</p>

Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then (vnto my no ſmall greefe now) a contemner of Gods true religion, and a delighter in that abhominable and Babilonical ſect: I ſpake that againſt the Proteſtants, which neither they nor I could iuſtly verifie: for no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delight haue the Papiſts, then by lyes and wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to abuſe the Proteſtants, defaming our Miniſters they care not how, and belying their liues, they care not in what. The which I hearing, and as then perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing: vpon their woords I reported, that vvhich I am hartily ſorie for. And yet I haue good hope, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring I vvas then a Papiſt, liuing in error and idolatry, and am now in the trueth, imbracing the ſame in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bovvels of my ſoule: the remainder of my life ſhall cut off the remembraunce of mine offence, and my dutie faithfully and truely diſcharged, ſhall ſtop the mouthes of all mine enemies. Thus loth to be ouer tedious to thee, and to come into any ill reproche my ſelfe: I deſire thee to reſpect me as I am, not as I vvas, and to forget my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on the eſtabliſhing of my faithe. In hope vvhereof, I commit thee to God, vvhom I pray to bleſſe thee vvith his heauenlie prouidence, and increaſe my faith, to thy comfort and profit. Amen.</p>
